We thank the referee for a constructive report! Below, the referee's comments are indented with ">>>" and our responses immediately follow. We have made changes to the paper text and flagged these changes by coloring the text purple.

Note that we have added 2 new authors to the manuscript: As this is an SDSS collaboration paper, I am following the SDSS collaboration policy, which lets survey architects join on to a paper if they contributed significantly to the survey. The new authors are scientists who contributed significantly to the APOGEE survey, and joined on to the paper after submission.


>>> The first point concerns equations (2), (3), and (8). The whole point of the analysis is to minimize the lhs of equation (2), which is parametrized as a function of the vertical angle in equation (3). This parametrization includes 5 parameters, yet the parameters c0 and b2 are ignored when constructing the objective function in equation (8). The authors state this and loosely argue that this is because only a1, a2 and b1 are physically important. However, I wonder whether the systematic errors here might be significant. In particular, this formalism could in theory allow for extreme cases in which the deviation defined in equation (2) is not minimal at all at the best fit point. I wonder how the predictions in figures 7 and 8 would change if one where to simply minimize over equation (2) instead. To give the readers an idea of the systematic errors involved, the authors should at least comment on this.

These are great points, thank you! We broadly agree that there are many possible objective functions and ways to handle the inference part of this method. The idea you propose would naturally lead to writing down an objective function that looks like a likelihood function, and indeed, our eventual goal is to generalize this method to use a likelihood function with an explicit model for the dependence of element abundance deviations on the actions. However, in this paper, we opt to keep the objective function simple, as this first paper is meant to be a demonstration of the concepts, and we have decided to stick to a "classical statistics" approach. We have added some text to section 6.2 to discuss these points.

With regards to the specific question about c0 and b2, we have tried re-doing the optimization of our adopted objective function while including c0^2 and b2^2, but find that the optimal parameters change by <a few per cent for all elements. We have added a sentence in section 6.2 to note this as well.


>>> The second point concerns the presentation of the formalism. [Mg/Fe] is used for illustration in figures 5 and 6, but figures 7 and 8 suggest that this abundance is inconsistent with the other abundances. In fact, in table 1, an analysis excluding [Mg/Fe] is presented. My question is thus whether a different abundance could be used to illustrate the process. If not, then the authors should explain why not.

Fair enough! We have swapped out [Mg/Fe] for [O/Fe] in all of the demonstration figures.


>>> Related to that, the authors cite https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0510-7 as a possible explanation for the mismatch between [Mg,Si/Fe] and the rest, but do not explain this further. A presentation of the average [X/Y]n as a function of J, and also as a function of z_max for illustration, would lend more credibility to this explanation. In particular, the spiral pattern in phase space shown in https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0510-7 appears most significant for orbits with z_max < 500 pc. If there is a mismatch between [Mg, SI/Fe] and the other abundances on these scales, then this explanation should be valid. From figure 2 of this manuscript, however, it appears that the difference in gradients between different abundances might be more significant for more energetic orbits, suggesting a different explanation (see next point).

We agree with the interest and think that tracing down this issue is an excellent project! With this response, we have included the requested figure, showing the mean abundance deviation as a function of log-Jz and log-z_max (the blue lines shows the running median). We do not see any immediate differences in Mg and Si compared to other elements. We also did not mean to suggest that the phase-spiral can definitively explain the differences, only that substructure in the orbital phases of stars in any samples used will in general bias this method (as they would for most other methods used!). We have rephrased some of the text about this in section 6.2 to try to make this clearer. We think that it is out of scope for this paper to track down the exact cause of the offsets in Mg and Si, but will certainly follow up on this in next work that will more robustly use this methodology to measure the properties of the disk mass distribution.


>>> The third point concerns one particular assumption in the formalism, namely that the potential be time-invariant. Unfortunately, this is mentioned only in Section 5 and not in the list of assumptions in Section 6. Relaxing this assumption could, however, have severe consequences for the statement that any moment of stellar label distributions can be used for the formalism, which is made in the abstract, as well as in Sections, 6 (before 6.1), 7.1, 7.4 and 8. In particular, it is known that actions oscillate in time-dependent potentials (see e.g https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015A%26A...584A.120B/abstract or https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/433/3/2576/1238827 ). Recent work suggests that this oscillation is more significant for more energetic orbits (Section 5.1 of https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.00737 ). If the time-dependence of the potential is significant here, it will be cause to an additional gradient in the second moment of stellar labels, increasing the dispersion at larger values of the actions. By eye, figure 2 of this manuscript suggests that this may be the case. A simple test would be to present the statistical error on [X/Y]n (J) alongside the function itself, in the same plot that I suggested above. This should be sufficient to conclude whether the time-dependence of the potential has an impact on the analysis or not (and whether it might be the reason for the mismatch between different abundances).

This is another interesting point! In the figures we shared based on the previous point, the purple lines (bounding the central line) show the 16th and 84th percentiles of the mean abundance deviations as a function of vertical action / z_max. For [Si/Fe], it does look like the dispersion steadily grows with increased action, but for the others it is not obvious. In any case, we would like to clarify that for the general methodology we do not actually need the potential to be time-invariant, we just need actions to exist and for the orbital phases to be uniform at any place in action-space. We agree that in practice, this may be satisfied mostly for time-invariant potentials, but the strict assumption is slightly weaker. That said, in the implementation we use here, we *do* assume that the potential is time-independent. We have added text to Section 6 and to the discussion noting these points - thank you!
