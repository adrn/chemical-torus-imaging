The manuscript entitled "Orbital Torus Imaging: Using Element Abundances to Map Orbits and Mass in the Milky Way" presents a novel method of inferring the mass distribution in the Milky Way, making use of measured kinematic data and element abundances of individual stars. To that end, the authors assume that the element abundances are functions of three invariant actions only. For the kinematic data measured, different mass models then imply a different set of actions. The condition that the mean abundance of any element cannot depend on the orbital phases conjugate to the actions then allows for the determination of a best fit mass model. The authors exemplify this process using 8 different abundances. While the results are consistent among 6 of them, [Mg/Fe] ans [Si/Fe] deviate significantly from the rest. The authors suggest that this may be due to the spiral structure of the vertical phase space as presented in https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0510-7.
The method presented in the manuscript is new and provides a valuable tool for inferring mass distributions which does not rely on the calculation of second moments of velocity. In that sense, it is a complementary method to a standard Jeans analysis, and potentially superior to a Jeans analysis in cases where the observed stars are not in dynamical equilibrium. As such, it can be a very valuable method, both to accurately infer mass distributions and, if applied alongside a Jeans analysis, also to determine whether an ensemble of stars is in dynamical equilibrium or not. While the latter is not mentioned in the manuscript, it appears to me that this constitutes a very interesting possibility for future research.
Overall, the manuscript is well written and clearly structured and the order of presentation is intuitive and instructive. Occasionally, some sentences should be rephrased slightly, or warrant a citation, e.g. "However, we expect that generative approaches ... since they will be protected by the arguments and proofs of Bayesian inference" on page 14. That aside, the strength and novelty of the proposed method and the overall careful and instructive presentation make this work suitable for publication in ApJ. Before publication, however, I see several points in the result section (Section 6) that need to be addressed:

- The first point concerns equations (2), (3), and (8). The whole point of the analysis is to minimize the lhs of equation (2), which is parametrized as a function of the vertical angle in equation (3). This parametrization includes 5 parameters, yet the parameters c0 and b2 are ignored when constructing the objective function in equation (8). The authors state this and loosely argue that this is because only a1, a2 and b1 are physically important. However, I wonder whether the systematic errors here might be significant. In particular, this formalism could in theory allow for extreme cases in which the deviation defined in equation (2) is not minimal at all at the best fit point. I wonder how the predictions in figures 7 and 8 would change if one where to simply minimize over equation (2) instead. To give the readers an idea of the systematic errors involved, the authors should at least comment on this.

- The second point concerns the presentation of the formalism. [Mg/Fe] is used for illustration in figures 5 and 6, but figures 7 and 8 suggest that this abundance is inconsistent with the other abundances. In fact, in table 1, an analysis excluding [Mg/Fe] is presented. My question is thus whether a different abundance could be used to illustrate the process. If not, then the authors should explain why not. Related to that, the authors cite https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0510-7 as a possible explanation for the mismatch between [Mg,Si/Fe] and the rest, but do not explain this further. A presentation of the average [X/Y]n as a function of J, and also as a function of z_max for illustration, would lend more credibility to this explanation. In particular, the spiral pattern in phase space shown in https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0510-7 appears most significant for orbits with z_max < 500 pc. If there is a mismatch between [Mg, SI/Fe] and the other abundances on these scales, then this explanation should be valid. From figure 2 of this manuscript, however, it appears that the difference in gradients between different abundances might be more significant for more energetic orbits, suggesting a different explanation (see next point).

- The third point concerns one particular assumption in the formalism, namely that the potential be time-invariant. Unfortunately, this is mentioned only in Section 5 and not in the list of assumptions in Section 6. Relaxing this assumption could, however, have severe consequences for the statement that any moment of stellar label distributions can be used for the formalism, which is made in the abstract, as well as in Sections, 6 (before 6.1), 7.1, 7.4 and 8. In particular, it is known that actions oscillate in time-dependent potentials (see e.g https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015A%26A...584A.120B/abstract or https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/433/3/2576/1238827 ). Recent work suggests that this oscillation is more significant for more energetic orbits (Section 5.1 of https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.00737 ). If the time-dependence of the potential is significant here, it will be cause to an additional gradient in the second moment of stellar labels, increasing the dispersion at larger values of the actions. By eye, figure 2 of this manuscript suggests that this may be the case. A simple test would be to present the statistical error on [X/Y]n (J) alongside the function itself, in the same plot that I suggested above. This should be sufficient to conclude whether the time-dependence of the potential has an impact on the analysis or not (and whether it might be the reason for the mismatch between different abundances).

I look forward to reading the revised manuscript once the above points have been addressed.
